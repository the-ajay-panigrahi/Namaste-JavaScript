# Namaste JavaScript

Following Akshay Saini's [Namaste JavaScript Youtube Playlist](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlasXeu85E9cQ32gLCvAvr9vNaUccPVNP&si=T6f8ZcGZ9LGZ4mxU4) to master JavaScript for interviews.

This repository is my playground for practicing concepts and building a strong JavaScript foundation.
