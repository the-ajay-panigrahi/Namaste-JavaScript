# Namaste JavaScript

Following Akshay Saini's [Namaste JavaScript Youtube Playlist](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlasXeu85E9cQ32gLCvAvr9vNaUccPVNP&si=T6f8ZcGZ9LGZ4mxU4) to master JavaScript for interviews.

This repository is my playground for practicing concepts and building a strong JavaScript foundation. 

**My Notes:** I'll be sharing my hand-typed notes (mostly in Markdown/PDF format) as I learn from the playlist.

Building a strong JS foundation for interview success!

Feel free to explore and use anything you find helpful.

Happy coding!
